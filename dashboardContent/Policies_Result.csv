Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with applicable law.Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc. or Amazon Seller Services Private Limited or any of its affiliates, or substantially all of their assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.Protection of Amazon and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users, or others.

We use the information that we have (subject to choices you make) as described below, and to provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms.

We can also make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product.Location-related information: We use location-related information – such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near – to provide, personalise and improve our Products, including ads, for you and others.

We use the information that we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off Facebook Products. For example, we use data that we have to investigate suspicious activity or breaches of our Terms or Policies, or to detect when someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Centre and Instagram Security Tips. Communicate with you. We use the information that we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Products and let you know about our Policies and Terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us. Research and innovate for social good.

For example, we analyse information that we have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research programmes. Return to top How is this information shared?  Your information is shared with others in the following ways: Sharing on Facebook ProductsPeople and accounts that you share and communicate with When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public or a customised list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions that you have taken on our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username, any information you share with a public audience, information in your public profile on Facebook, and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in search results or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs and offline media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.  Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Facebook and Instagram. Content that others share or reshare about you. You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience that you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.  People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content. Information about your active status or presence on our Products. People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products. Apps, websites and third-party integrations on or using our Products. When you choose to use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites that you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites that you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.  Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information that you choose to share with them, including information that your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you. Note: We are in the process of restricting developers' data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in three months, and we are changing login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.New owner. If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner. Sharing with third-party partners We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties that we share information with: Partners who use our analytics services. We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account. Advertisers. We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser. Measurement partners. We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners. Partners offering goods and services in our Products.

Vendors and service providers. We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analysing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.

Return to top How do the Facebook Companies work together?  Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products that you use. We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their Terms and Policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products. Return to top How can I manage or delete information about me?  We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and delete your data. Learn more in your Facebook settings and Instagram settings.  We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products or until your account is deleted – whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after six months. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content that you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.  When you delete your account, we delete things that you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover this information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the Facebook settings and Instagram settings. Return to top How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?

This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction and is consistent with internationally recognised standards.When we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorised use of the Products, breaches of our Terms or Policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory enquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.

It doesnât matter whether you have become a client or whether there is a contract between us or not, this document is intended to ensure transparency in the use of your personal data.

In case of any questions or complaints, you can contact us at support at adva-soft.com anytime.                                                        2. Purpose of Storage                                                            When you create a user account or enter into a contract with us as a customer, the account linked to your account is created in our system. It incorporates the data provided by you, information about your order, and, if necessary, your billing information (""Customer Information""). We store and process this data because otherwise we wonât be able to fulfill our contractual obligations.                            Website                                The moment you start navigating our website, your computer provides us with your IP address and, depending on what you do and what your computer settings are, we start storing small text files on your hard drive (""cookies""). These files help us improve your user experience on our website. It's a kind of short-term memory of your browser.                                                                Text files (""log files"") are also created in our system. They may contain the following information about you: the model of your computer and the type of its operating system, your browser type and version, the URL of the web page you are coming from, and the time. Log files can not be assigned to specific persons. We do not try to link this data to cookies or IP addresses. However, we reserve the right to retrospectively evaluate log files in individual cases if we become aware of concrete indications for their unlawful use. Log files help us understand what types of computers our website should support and when a lot of (or few) people use it. Based on this information, we can adjust our web pages structure, servers, and database systems to better meet the needs of our customers.                            Social media plug-ins                                We currently use social media plug-ins provided by Facebook and Twitter. When you visit our website, no personal data is passed on to these providers. You can easily recognize a provider by its logo on the respective button and interact directly with it via that button. The moment you click the button, the plug-in provider starts receiving the information about the website you came from. By activating the plug-in, you give its provider access to your personal data (for plug-in providers in the USA) (in the case of Facebook in Germany, IP addresses are anonymized immediately after data collection). Since plug-in providers collect data mainly via cookies, we recommend that you delete all the cookies in the security settings of your browser.                                                                We have no influence on data processing operations, nor are we aware of the full extent of data collection, purpose of processing, and retention periods. We also cannot delete the data collected by a plug-in provider.                                                                A plug-in provider stores the data gathered about you as user profiles and utilizes them for the purposes of advertising, market research, and/or tailor-made website design. That is done (also for non-logged in users) to provide needs-based advertising and to you inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the user profiles information being used by contacting a plug-in provider.                                                                We, from our side, use plug-ins to interact with social networks and other users so that we can improve our offers to make them more interesting for you as our customer. Article 6 (1) (f) of the DSGVO serves as the legal basis for the use of plug-ins.                                                                Your personal data transfer takes place depending on whether you have an account with a plug-in provider and are logged in there or not. If you are logged in, the data collected while you have been using our website will be assigned to your existing plug-in account. If you click the plug-in button and, for example, link to the providerâs page, this information will be stored in your user account and shared with your contacts publicly. Thatâs why we recommend that you log out the social network regularly, especially after using the plug-in, as this will prevent your personal data from being transferred to the plug-in provider.                                                                Below you could find privacy statements of the Facebook and Twitter plug-in providers, including their addresses and privacy notices URLs, explaining in detail how they collect and process data. Moreover, youâll get information on your rights and privacy protection settings options.                            Facebook plug-ins (Like button)                                Facebook (Facebook Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California, 94025, USA) plug-ins are integrated in our website. They can be recognized by the Facebook logo or ""Like"" inscription. For more details on Facebook plug-ins, please follow the link: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/. Facebook plug-ins provide a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook server. Facebook finds out that you have visited our website through your IP address. The moment you click the âLikeâ button, while being logged in your Facebook account, the contents of our pages become linked to your Facebook profile. As a result, Facebook can assign the information about your actions on our website to your user account.

We use this technical data to fully investigate the problems you report in order to reproduce and solve them as soon as possible. We reserve the right to ask for further details should we need more information. We can do that by sending requests to your email address. Email communication is the most effective way to respond to your needs.                                                                You also voluntarily send us many useful suggestions and recommendations to improve our apps. We appreciate your doing so, as your ideas help us perfect our apps so that they better serve your needs. We store your feedback, altogether with your email addresses, in our Suggestions database to implement the features you are interested in in due course. When those requested features are added to our apps, we do our best to inform you about that as soon as possible.                                                                When investigating the problems you report, we sometimes ask you to send us your original photos as well as some screenshots or videos illustrating what is wrong with one of our apps. Thanks to them, we get a more comprehensive idea of what is going on and at the same time obtain the object for testing. We keep this data for some time to have it accessible in case you inform us that the same issues start reproducing again. We would like to assure you that the multimedia you provide for that purpose is used only by those team members who are responsible for reproducing and solving the problems and is stored temporarily. It is not shared to anybody else. We keep it safe and secure.                            Personal information shared through social networks                                We may get access to some kind of personal information you reveal when you share your photos to social networks through our apps, including, but not limited to, your name, place of birth, place of work, address, and your photo gallery. However, we donât do that. We neither collect this information, nor use it in any other way.                            Location information (iOS apps)                                The moment you allow our apps to access your photo albums, you allow them to access the EXIF data attached to your photos. Moreover, if the Location Services option is turned on on your device, you automatically make it possible for the apps to determine and track the precise real-time location of the device you are using. Though accessible, this personal data is neither used nor shared.                                                        3.

We change the tools from time to time if that makes sense for legal, technical, or economic reasons.

Effective 4 February 2021 | Archived versions | Download PDF
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites and devices, such as Search, YouTube and Google Home
Platforms such as the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, such as ads and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content such as emails and photos, or to see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all; for example, searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.

INFORMATION THAT GOOGLE COLLECTS
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users – from figuring out basic stuff such as which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information that we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application or device that you’re using. This helps us do things such as maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.
Things that you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information – like an email address to receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content that you create, upload or receive from others when using our services. This includes things such as email you write and receive, photos and videos that you save, docs and spreadsheets you create and comments that you make on YouTube videos.
Information that we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers and devices that you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features such as automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information that we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including operator name and phone number and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time and referrer URL of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers – for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things such as your device type, operator name, crash reports and which apps you’ve installed.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video that you might like. The activity information that we collect may include:
Terms that you search for
Videos that you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information when you use audio features
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history that you’ve synced with your Google Account
If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.

Your location information
We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features such as driving directions for your weekend getaway or show times for movies playing near you.
Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:
GPS
IP address
Sensor data from your device
Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data that we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases and server logs.

WHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA
We use data to build better services
We use the information that we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to deliver our services, such as processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to ensure that our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services – for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organised their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalised services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customise our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalised content and customised search results. For example, Security Check-Up provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information such as apps that you’ve already installed and videos that you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalised ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for 'mountain bikes', you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.
We don’t show you personalised ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation or health.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the 'tap to call' button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to Ad Settings
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyse data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimise product design. And we also use data about the ads with which you interact to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information that we collect, such as your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, such as an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users and the public
We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks and technical issues that could harm Google, our users or the public.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyse your content to provide you with things like customised search results, personalised ads or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyse your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognise patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases that you ask it to translate.
We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. For example, this helps people identify an email coming from you.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

YOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it’s used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services.

Export your data
You can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law.
To delete your information, you can:
Delete your content from specific Google services

Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account
Delete your information
And finally, Inactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.
There are other ways to control the information that Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things such as remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.
SHARING YOUR INFORMATION
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads, depending on your Shared Endorsements setting.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organisations or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student, or work for an organisation that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, such as your email
View statistics regarding your account, such as how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help us with customer support.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests that we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – such as publishers, advertisers, developers or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Check-Up and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorised access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
EXPORTING & DELETING YOUR INFORMATION
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

Export your data

RETAINING YOUR INFORMATION
We retain the data that we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it and how you configure your settings:
Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as the content that you create or upload. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time.
Other data is deleted or anonymised automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymised form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s data retention periods, including how long it takes for us to delete your information.

COMPLIANCE & COOPERATION WITH REGULATORS
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.

We at PhonePe value the trust placed upon us and strive to offer the best experience to You. Our Grievance policy has been designed to resolve customer grievances in a timely and efficient manner, while treating our customers fairly and courteously.
Our endeavour is to provide You with a seamless experience while transacting via PhonePe App and when required, our in-app customer redressal support process, is able to address all Your concerns. In rare circumstances where, owing to various human, network or system errors, some issues arise requiring a more focused and customised redressal, You may refer to the following redressal mechanism in the sequential order.
Grievance redressal
We have formulated an escalation matrix to ensure that Your concerns are routed and addressed by the right team. You are requested to read and understand the below escalation matrix to ensure a timely redressal of Your concern.
We recommend You to carefully go through our help pages that provide self-help to our customers. For queries and concerns that are not addressed through the help pages, You can contact our customer support team through phone, email or through PhonePe App.
Our in-app support channel is able to resolve a vast majority of customer complaints. In any uncommon scenario, where You wish to escalate the concern to next level, You need to ensure that You have already exhausted the previous level(s) and Your concern remains un-resolved or not resolved to Your satisfaction.

We aim to resolve all Your complaints/queries within 3 business days.
Resolution of Your complaint may get delayed due to operational or technical reasons. In such a scenario, You will be proactively informed of the timelines during which Your complaint will be addressed.
In a few scenarios while the resolution to a complaint is instant, it may take time for it to get reflected in the system. For example, refund approval can be instant, but it may take 3-10 days to reflect money into the account. Please note that such delays are attributable to banking and other operational issues.
Complaints related to ‘fraud and risk assessment’ often take longer to investigate due to involvement of multiple agencies. The resolution time in such cases is dependent on the severity and complexity of the case. You shall be proactively informed of the timelines in such cases.

31,  Telegram.txt,"Telegram Privacy Policy EnglishBahasa IndonesiaBahasa MelayuDeutschEspañolFrançaisItalianoNederlandsO‘zbekPolskiPortuguês (Brasil)TürkçeБеларускаяРусскийУкраїнськаالعربيةفارسی한국어 TwitterHomeFAQAppsAPIProtocolTelegram Privacy Policy1. IntroductionThis Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc. (“Telegram”), use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the “Services”). For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ refers to Telegram, and ‘you’ refers to you, the user of the Services.1.1 Privacy PrinciplesTelegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:We don't use your data to show you ads.We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.1.2. Terms of ServiceThis Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at https://telegram.org/tos. This Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.1.3. Table of ContentsThis Privacy Policy explains the following:the legal basis for processing your personal data;what personal data we may collect from you;how we keep your personal data safe;what we may use your personal data for;who your personal data may be shared with; and your rights regarding your personal data.1.4. EEA RepresentativeIf you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services. However, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data. 2. Legal Ground for Processing Your Personal DataWe process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: (1) providing effective and innovative Services to our users; and (2) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.3. What Personal Data We Use3.1. Basic Account DataTelegram is a communication service. You provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public. We don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like. We do not require your screen name to be your real name. Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name. This way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).3.2. Your E-mail AddressWhen you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email. This address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it. That's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.3.3. Your Messages3.3.1. Cloud ChatsTelegram is a cloud service. We store messages, photos, videos and documents from your cloud chats on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups. All data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions. This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.3.3.2. Secret ChatsSecret chats use end-to-end encryption. This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. There is no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages. We do not store your secret chats on our servers. We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats. For the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent to or from.3.3.3. Media in Secret ChatsWhen you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server. This key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient. They can then download and decipher the file. This means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient. We don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to. We periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.3.3.4. Public ChatsIn addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups. All public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above). Like everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.3.3.5. Phone Number and ContactsTelegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph. We ask your permission before syncing your contacts.We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications. We only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram. When you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram. You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings.If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG). If you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code. Telegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.3.3.6. CookiesThe only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web. We do not use cookies for profiling or advertising. The cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience. Your browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.4. Keeping Your Personal Data Safe4.1. Storing DataIf you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands. These are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space. However, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram. As such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers. All data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.4.2. End-to-End Encrypted DataYour messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient. Before this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient. While Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information. In this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.4.3. RetentionUnless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.5. Processing Your Personal Data5.1. Our ServicesTelegram is a cloud service. We will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.5.2. Safety and SecurityTelegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations. Telegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers. To improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc. If collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.5.3. Spam and AbuseTo prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients. If a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently. You can send an appeal using @Spambot. In case of more serious violations, your account may be banned. We may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.5.4. Cross-Device FunctionalityWe may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.5.5. Advanced featuresWe may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features. For example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen. To do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently. A similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”). To turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.5.6. No AdsUnlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes. Telegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service. 6. Bot Messages6.1. EcosystemTelegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots. Bots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features. By performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.6.2. How Bots Can Receive DataYou can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:By sending messages to a bot.By using an inline bot.By participating in a group with a bot.By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).6.3. What Data Bots ReceiveIn any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).Bots can also receive the following data when you interact with them.Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads). If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g. @gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot. This query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service. We will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access. If the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group. The interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.6.4. Bots Are Not Maintained by TelegramOther than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram. They are completely independent from us. They should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.7. Third Party Payment Services7.1. Payment InformationThe Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0. Telegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world. It is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details. Neither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information. Although we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram. Please study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them. 7.2. Credit Card InformationWhen making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server. Your credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers. We do not access and do not store your credit card information. When you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a token that you can reuse for future payments. It is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.7.3 Shipping InformationWhen you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer. We can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases. We will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.7.4. Clearing Payment InformationYou can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment & Shipping Info’. If you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.7.5. Payment DisputesDue to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.8. Who Your Personal Data May Be Shared With8.1. Other Telegram UsersOther users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA. Note that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk. 8.2. Telegram’s Group CompaniesWe may share your personal data with: (1) our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands; and (2) Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services. We will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data. This will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies. If you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.8.3. Law Enforcement AuthoritiesIf Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities. So far, this has never happened. When it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.9. Your Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us9.1. Your RightsUnder applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data. You have a right to: (1) request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller; (2) delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data; (3) restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data; (4) correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you; and (5) lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.9.2. Exercising Your RightsIf you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.9.3. Data SettingsYou can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings (using one of our mobile apps). Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services. You can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.10. Deleting data10.1. AccountsIf you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page. Deleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud. This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.10.2. MessagesIn secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending. Otherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history. This means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history. As soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides. There is no time limit. Any party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants. Note that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.10.3. Self-Destructing MessagesMessages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct. As soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts. When the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.). Media with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews. The timer is triggered when they are viewed.10.4. Account Self-DestructionBy default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud. You can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.11.

is otherwise obtained or generated by us in connection with your use of our cloud based messaging services the Services For the purposes of this Privacy Policy we us and our refers to Telegram and you refers to you the user of the Services 1 1 Privacy PrinciplesTelegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data We don t use your data to show you ads We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature rich messaging service 1 2 Terms of ServiceThis Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at https telegram org tos This Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms 1 3 Table of ContentsThis Privacy Policy explains the following the legal basis for processing your personal data what personal data we may collect from you how we keep your personal data safe what we may use your personal data for who your personal data may be shared with and your rights regarding your personal data 1 4 EEA RepresentativeIf you live in a country in the European Economic Area EEA the Services are provided by Telegram which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services However as Telegram is located outside the EEA we have designated one of our EEA based group companies Telegram UK Holdings Ltd 71 75 Shelton Street Covent Garden London England WC2H 9JQ as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data 2 Legal Ground for Processing Your Personal DataWe process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests including 1 providing effective and innovative Services to our users and 2 to detect prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data 3 What Personal Data We Use3 1 Basic Account DataTelegram is a communication service You provide your mobile number and basic account data which may include profile name profile picture and about information to create a Telegram account To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are the screen name you choose your profile pictures and your username should you choose to set one on Telegram are always public We don t want to know your real name gender age or what you like We do not require your screen name to be your real name Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name This way your mother can have the public name Johnny Depp while appearing as Mom to you and as Boss to her underlings at work or the other way around depending on how these relationships are structured 3 2 Your E mail AddressWhen you enable 2 step verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature you can opt to set up a password recovery email This address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it That s right no marketing or we miss you bullshit 3 3 Your Messages3 3 1 Cloud ChatsTelegram is a cloud service We store messages photos videos and documents from your cloud chats on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third party backups All data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data 3 3 2 Secret ChatsSecret chats use end to end encryption This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know There is no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages We do not store your secret chats on our servers We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats For the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud you can only access those messages from the device they were sent to or from 3 3 3 Media in Secret ChatsWhen you send photos videos or files via secret chats before being uploaded each item is encrypted with a separate key not known to the server This key and the file s location are then encrypted again this time with the secret chat s key and sent to your recipient They can then download and decipher the file This means that the file is technically on one of Telegram s servers but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient We don t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to We periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space 3 3 4 Public ChatsIn addition to private messages Telegram also supports public channels and public groups All public chats are cloud chats see section 3 3 1 above Like everything on Telegram the data you post in public communities is encrypted both in storage and in transit but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone 3 3 5 Phone Number and ContactsTelegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph We ask your permission before syncing your contacts We store your up to date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications We only need the number and name first and last for this to work and store no other data about your contacts Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram When you open the Invite friends interface we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings Privacy Security Data Settings If you are using Android Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs READ CALL LOG If you grant this permission Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code Telegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log 3 3 6 CookiesThe only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web We do not use cookies for profiling or advertising The cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience Your browser should allow you to control these cookies including whether or

Personal Data Safe4 1 Storing DataIf you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands These are third party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space However the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram As such we do not share your personal data with such data centers All data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access 4 2 End to End Encrypted DataYour messages media and files from secret chats see section 3 3 2 above as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient Before this data reaches our servers it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient While Telegram servers will handle this end to end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data we have no ways of deciphering the actual information In this case we neither store nor process your personal data rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don t have 4 3 RetentionUnless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services 5 Processing Your Personal Data5 1 Our ServicesTelegram is a cloud service

Your information is shared with others in the following ways: Sharing on Facebook ProductsPeople and accounts that you share and communicate with When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public or a customised list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions that you have taken on our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username, any information you share with a public audience, information in your public profile on Facebook, and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in search results or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs and offline media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.  Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Facebook and Instagram. Content that others share or reshare about you. You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience that you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.  People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content. Information about your active status or presence on our Products. People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products. Apps, websites and third-party integrations on or using our Products. When you choose to use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites that you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites that you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.  Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information that you choose to share with them, including information that your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you. Note: We are in the process of restricting developers' data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in three months, and we are changing login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.New owner. If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner. Sharing with third-party partners We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties that we share information with: Partners who use our analytics services. We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account. Advertisers. We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser. Measurement partners. We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners. Partners offering goods and services in our Products. When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public information and other information that you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details. Vendors and service providers. We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analysing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.

Law enforcement or legal requests. We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below.  Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in the Facebook settings and Instagram settings. Return to top How do the Facebook Companies work together?  Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products that you use. We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their Terms and Policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products. Return to top How can I manage or delete information about me?  We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and delete your data. Learn more in your Facebook settings and Instagram settings.  We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products or until your account is deleted – whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after six months. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content that you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.  When you delete your account, we delete things that you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover this information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the Facebook settings and Instagram settings. Return to top How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?

33,  S  D  Maid  Pro-  Unlocker.txt,"SD Maid - PrivacySD Maid and your Privacy				This document explains what information SD Maid collects, why it's done and how it's done.				SD Maid requests the permission ""android.permission.INTERNET"" to communicate with my server. This is nothing you need to be concerned about and it is nothing I want to hide. If you are looking for 10 pages of cryptic legal text, I will have to disappoint you. What I can offer is an honest explanation about what is done and why it is done. SD Maid has grown so much in both user numbers and features that I need a few tools to help me keep an overview. The goal for any of this is to help me improve SD Maid.				I do not collect personal information, neither do I sell or otherwise misappropriate any collected data.				SD Maid works perfectly fine without internet. If you don't have internet or want to block SD Maid from it, it will have no adverse effect.				If you still have questions or concerns after reading all the details, feel free to contact me!			Crash tracking				When a crash happens a report will be generated that contains the crash details and information about SD Maid and your device. It saves you the trouble of having to tell me about a crash and makes it easier for me to fix it. Google already provides some crash tracking via Google Play, but it's not very comfortable to use and fairly unreliable in terms of what crashs you are told about. This is voluntary and you can opt out of this in the settings.				SD Maid v4+ uses Bugsnag. The sourcecode of their client side plugin is available on Github. The crash data is stored on their servers and their privacy policy applies.                        MatomoMatomo is an open source analytics framework. It's sourcecode is also available on GitHub, server-side and client-side.				Matomo has two purposes. The first purpose is to aggregated global statistics. While I do get some numbers from Google Play, not everyone has access to Google Play and others don't want to use it. It also allows me to track inofficial device features, e.g. how many devices are rooted, which Google Play doesn't track, but is a fairly important stat for SD Maid.				The second purpose is to know more about how SD Maid is used. I talk with many users via mails, read many reviews and often even watch discussion about SD Maid on social media or forums, but this is only a small glimpse. Matomo will help me to get a better understanding on a large scale. Is there a missing language? What the are the most and least used features? Having this information will allow me to better allocate my time and resources. This is also voluntary and you can opt out of this in the settings.			Update-check				Upon launch SD Maid will tell my server its version and in return get told if there is an update. There are quite a few people who use SD Maid without Google Play and this allows them know about updates without manually checking.			ClutterReporter				The ClutterReporter is a manual tool inside the Explorer and CorpseFinder. It allows you to tell me about false results or report files/directories that SD Maid doesn't know. You use it to tell me to which app a file or directory belongs. I regularly review these reports and improve SD Maids databases accordingly.

Naturally, these items may contain personal or sensitive information. However, DiskDigger does not do anything with this data except display it and allow the user to recover it (save it to a new location, as chosen by the user). DiskDigger does not write or transmit any recoverable data without the user's knowledge.DiskDigger requires the permission to read and write your device's internal and/or external storage. This is for the purpose of scanning your device's memory to find recoverable files. If your device is rooted, DiskDigger also asks the permission for full access to your device's storage. This is for the purpose of performing a complete low-level scan of the device's internal memory and any removable media, to maximize the effectiveness of the data recovery. The app does not use these permissions for any other purpose.The recoverable results shown by the app come from your device's local storage, and no other source. After the scan process is complete, the app does not leave any other long-running processes in the background, or perform any additional actions when the device starts up.Anonymous crash reportingIf the app experiences a crash, it may automatically send an anonymous crash report to the distribution channel through which it was installed (e.g. the Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore, Huawei App Store, etc).

The categories we use below to describe personal information are those enumerated in the CCPA.

We disclose information for a business purpose to service providers and contractors, which are companies or individuals that we engage to conduct activities on our behalf. Service providers and contractors are restricted from using personal information for any purpose not related to our engagement.

Entities to whom we “sell” information are called “third parties.”

We do not collect education information. For disclosures regarding health information, please see Health Care Centers and Pharmacies below. Personal information may be disclosed in additional, more limited circumstances, as described in Our Disclosure of Personal Information above. We also disclose personal information to the companies that provide products and services to our members for their own marketing purposes as described above (see “Our Disclosure of Personal Information” section above).

Right to Know and Right to Request Deletion. You have the right to request access to personal information collected about you and information regarding the source of that personal information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the third parties and service providers with whom we disclose it. You also have a right to request that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions. You may make such requests by submitting a request. You can also submit your request by calling 1-800-605-3364.

To provide or delete specific pieces of personal information we will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We will verify your request by matching information we request or you provide with your request to information we have collected previously, and/or by using a third-party verification service that will ask a series of questions to validate your identity.

Do Not Sell my Personal Information/Right to Opt Out. You have a right to opt out from future “sales” of personal information. You can exercise your Do Not Sell My Personal Information rights by contacting us using the methods above; or making your request via our “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” webpage. You can prevent digital tracking information from being sold by visiting the Cookie Preferences page from the Do Not Sell My Personal Information page. Any opt-out choices you make will only apply to the specific email address that you provide when making the request, and to the browser that you are using when you submit an opt-out for digital tracking technologies.

Note that although we will not “sell” your personal information after you opt out from the sale of personal information, we will continue to disclose some personal information with our suppliers (acting as our service providers) for our business purposes. Selecting the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link and or opting out of cookies and digital tracking technologies will not stop the use of previously sold personal information or stop all interest-based advertising.

Right to Not Experience Discrimination. You have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights set out in the CCPA.

Use of an Authorized Agent. You may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us or confirm that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. You must use the Third Party Authorization form available on our website to authorize third parties to make such requests on your behalf.

Request Statistics. During the previous calendar year, we received and responded to these types of requests as follows:

Number received	Number complied (whole/in part)	Number denied **	Average number of days to respond ***	Delete converted to opt out (subset of denied)****
Requests to know	522	494	28	17	N/A
Requests to delete	117	94	23	16	11
Requests to opt out*	85,078	79,060	6,018	1	N/A
*Requests to opt out of the sale of information are accepted from all Costco members in the United States, and not limited to the residents of California. These numbers represent all requests to opt out received.

**Denied requests: Requests to know and to delete are denied when we are unable to verify the identity of the requestor. We are unable to process an opt-out request if the data provided by the requestor, at the time of the submission, cannot be matched to our records.

*** Average number of days to respond: The processing of requests to opt out is fully automated. All successful submissions are completed on the day of receipt.

**** Delete requests converted to opt out: We process denied delete requests as opt-out requests, if possible. We do not accept requests to opt out from non-members as we do not sell non-member information. For this reason, non-member delete requests are cancelled if we are unable to verify the identity of the requestor, and no further action will be taken.

Additionally, California residents who have provided personal information to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Members”) may request information about whether Costco has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We comply with this law by offering California Members a choice about the disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, and you can make or change such choice by following the instructions under “Choice and Control of Personal Information” in this Privacy Notice.

SPECIAL INFORMATION FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS
Residents of the State of Nevada have the right to opt out of the sale of certain types of their information to other companies who will sell or license their information to others. At this time, Costco does not engage in such sales. If you are a Nevada resident and would like more information about our data protection practices, please email US_Privacy@costco.com.

AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION USAGE AND POLICY
We use Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) technology to collect information relating to vehicles present on or near some Costco warehouses and facilities. We use this information to detect, prevent, investigate, report and address incidents or illegal activities occurring in or around our warehouses and facilities, to maintain security for our employees, vendors, members and other visitors, and for loss prevention purposes.

Costco restricts access to ALPR technology and ALPR Information to only those Costco personnel with a need-to-know such information for their job requirements. Access is granted to senior management for the warehouse and region where the technology is in use, to our loss prevention and security personnel, and to specific individuals on our procurement team. These personnel receive training in data security and the sensitivity of ALPR Information. Costco’s use of ALPR technology is overseen by Costco Corporate Purchasing and the Director for Warehouse Operations.

ALPR Information is not accessible across warehouses and is stored locally on servers subject to Costco’s access control processes and procedures. ALPR Information is password protected, encrypted in transit and storage, and not used for purposes other than those disclosed in this Privacy Notice. Costco takes reasonable measures to ensure accuracy and integrity of the ALPR information it collects, including maintaining access controls and access logs. When using this information in connection with the investigation of an incident, Costco considers all available information, including information from other systems.

ALPR Information is stored for approximately 180 days before it is permanently deleted, unless we need to retain the information for compliance with applicable law, investigation of specific incidents, upon request of law enforcement or other valid legal processes.

Costco may disclose ALPR Information when we believe doing so is necessary to:

Protect the rights or property of ourselves or others, including detecting, investigating, and reporting suspicious activities to law enforcement;
Comply with applicable law or respond to legal process requests, including from law enforcement or other government agencies; or
Protect our Costco companies, our property and inventory, our shoppers, members, employees, or the public.
When ALPR Information is necessary for one of the above purposes, Costco uses reasonable safeguards, including encryption, to secure the transfer of ALPR information. Costco does not sell ALPR Information to third parties.

SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We take what we believe to be reasonable and appropriate steps to help protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and therefore we are unable to guarantee the security of your personal information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please let us know (see “Contact Us” below).

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE
We will update this Privacy Notice when necessary to reflect changes in our Services, how we use personal information, or the applicable law. When we post changes to this Privacy Notice, we will revise the ""Last Updated"" date at the top of the Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to the Privacy Notice, we will provide notice or obtain consent regarding such changes as may be required by law.

In order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure or other similar risks, we have put in place all legally required physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect from you. We will ensure that we safeguard your personal information in accordance with applicable law.
For example, when you access your Mi Account, you can choose to use our two-step verification program for better security. When you send or receive data from your Xiaomi device to our servers, we make sure they are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) and other algorithms.
All your personal information is stored on secure servers, and protected in controlled facilities. We classify your information based on importance and sensitivity, and ensure that your personal information has the required level of security. We have special access controls for cloud-based data storage, and we regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against any unauthorized access and use.
We conduct due diligence on business partners and third party service providers to make sure that they are able to protect your personal information. We also check that appropriate security standards are maintained by these third parties by putting in place appropriate contractual restrictions, and where necessary, carrying out audits and assessments. In addition, our employees and those of our business partners and third party service providers who access your personal information are subject to enforceable contractual obligations of confidentiality.
We conduct security and privacy protection training courses and tests to enhance our employees' awareness of the importance of protecting personal information. We will take all practicable and legally required steps to safeguard your personal information. However, you should be aware that the use of the Internet is not entirely secure, and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any personal information when transferred from you or to you via the Internet.
We handle personal data breaches as required by applicable data protection law which includes, where required, notifying the breach to the relevant data protection supervisory authority and data subjects.4.2    What you can doYou can set a unique password for Xiaomi by not disclosing your sign-in password or account information to anybody (unless such person is duly authorized by you) to avoid password leaks to other websites which may harm your account security at Xiaomi. Whenever possible, please do not disclose the verification code you received to anyone (including those who claim to be Xiaomi customer service). Whenever you sign in as a Mi Account user on Xiaomi websites, particularly on somebody else's computer or on public Internet terminals, you should always sign out at the end of your session.
Xiaomi cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by third party accessing your personal information as a result of your failure to keep your personal information private. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you must notify us immediately if there is any unauthorized use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security.
Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your personal information.4.3    Retention policyWe retain personal information for the period necessary for the purpose of the information collection described in this Privacy Policy, or as required by applicable laws. We will cease to retain and delete or anonymize personal information once the purpose of collection is fulfilled, or after we confirm your request for erasure, or after we terminate the operation of the corresponding service. An exception to this is personal information that we are processing for public interest, scientific, historical research, or statistical purposes. Xiaomi will continue to retain this type of information for longer than its standard retention period, where permitted based on applicable laws or your request, even if further data processing is not related to the original purpose of collection.5    Your rightsControlling your personal information5.1    Controlling settingsXiaomi recognizes that privacy concerns differ from person to person. Therefore, we provide examples of ways Xiaomi makes available to you to restrict the collection, use, disclosure or processing of your personal information and control your privacy settings, such as sign in or out of the Mi Account.

Information across Facebook Products and devices: We connect information about your activities on different Facebook Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product.Location-related information: We use location-related information-such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and improve our Products, including ads, for you and others.

For example, we analyze information we have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research programs.III. How is this information shared?Your information is shared with others in the following ways:Sharing on Facebook ProductsPeople and accounts you share and communicate withWhen you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Facebook and Instagram.Content others share or reshare about youYou should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.Information about your active status or presence on our Products.People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.New owner.If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.Sharing with Third-Party PartnersWe work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share information with:Partners who use our analytics services.We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products.

With regard to the contractual relationships of the users with the respective Participating Platforms, for the purposes of which Paytm’s SSOID service is or can be used in accordance with these T&Cs, these can alternatively have their own commercial and user terms and conditions. These business or user terms and conditions are available on the respective Participating Platforms. For the respective contents of the Participating Platforms, the respective affiliate of Paytm is solely responsible only for those content that it actually operates. For the SSOID service, these T&Cs apply exclusively, whereas for the use of the Participating Platforms, their business and user terms and conditions apply along with these T&Cs. The SSOID shall be owned and operated by One97 for use on all Participating Platforms.
For the use of Paytm’s SSOID service, the user must register. Registration as a user is only allowed if the user meets the eligibility criteria as set out in these T&Cs. Each user can set up only one user account. The user is obliged to provide correct and complete information during the registration and use of the SSOID service.
The login data is intended solely for personal use by the user and therefore always to be kept secret and safe. The user is not entitled to share his login details with third parties to use the SSOID service or to disclose them otherwise. The user is obliged to inform Paytm immediately on becoming aware of and/or suspecting a case of any unauthorized use, disclosure and/or misuse of their access data or of their user account. Furthermore, the user is obliged not to use the user account of another person.
Submission of the duly completed registration form by the user simply provides invitation to us to make an offer to enter into the agreement on the use of our SSOID service (hereinafter the SSOID Agreement). Our offer for the conclusion of the SSOID Agreement is then effected by the fact that Paytm sends the user a confirmation by e mail, in which a confirmation link is included next to the user name and the password for the SSOID Service. By the user clicking on this confirmation link, the user accepts Paytm’s offer, so that in this way the SSOID Agreement enters into force. Conclusion of the SSOID Agreement may, also be effected through other communication modes and following such processes which help achieve the same purpose as the aforementioned e-mail confirmation process.
Paytm is entitled to reject individual users without giving reasons.
The user guarantees that the data submitted for their user account (and any other information that is otherwise left for Paytm) are in all respects complete, true, accurate and not misleading. Any changes to user’s data should be promptly updated correctly in its account.

How is this information shared?Your information is shared with others in the following ways:Sharing on Facebook ProductsPeople and accounts you share and communicate withWhen you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Facebook and Instagram.Content others share or reshare about youYou should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.Information about your active status or presence on our Products.People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.New owner.If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.Sharing with Third-Party PartnersWe work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share information with:Partners who use our analytics services.We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account.Advertisers.We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.Measurement partners.We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.Partners offering goods and services in our Products.When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details.Vendors and service providers.We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.Researchers and academics.We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.Law enforcement or legal requests.We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below.Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use. We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products.V. How can I manage or delete information about me?We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm? We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others: In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products. Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations. VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services? We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy.

Our products and services—including Snapchat, Bitmoji, Spectacles, advertising, and others that link to this Privacy Policy—provide fast and fun ways to express yourself, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together!When you use these services, you’ll share some information with us. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the controls we give you to access, update, and delete your information.That’s why we’ve written this Privacy Policy. And it’s why we’ve tried to write it in a way that’s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, just contact us.You should read our entire Privacy Policy, but when you only have a few minutes or want to remember something later on, you can always take a look at this summary—so you can review some of the basics in just a few minutes.Information We CollectThere are three basic categories of information we collect:Information you provide.Information we get when you use our services.Information we get from third parties.Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.Information You ProvideWhen you interact with our services, we collect information that you provide to us. For example, most of our services require you to set up a Snapchat account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as your name, username, password, email address, phone number, and date of birth. We may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as a profile picture or Bitmoji avatar. Other services, such as commerce products, may require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information.Of course, you’ll also provide us whatever information you send through our services, such as Snaps and Chats. Keep in mind that the users who view your Snaps, Chats, and any other content can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to Snapchat as well: Don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.When you contact customer support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer or that we need to resolve your question.Information We Get When You Use Our ServicesWhen you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. We might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Story, saw a specific ad for a certain period of time, and sent a few Snaps. Here’s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:Usage Information. We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:how you interact with our services, such as which filters you view or apply to Snaps, which Stories you watch on Discover, whether you’re using Spectacles, or which search queries you submit.how you communicate with other Snapchatters, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).Content Information. We collect content you create on our services, such as custom stickers, and information about the content you create or provide, such as if the recipient has viewed the content and the metadata that is provided with the content.Device Information. We collect information from and about the devices you use. For example, we collect:information about your hardware and software, such as the hardware model, operating system version, device memory, advertising identifiers, unique application identifiers, apps installed, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, battery level, and time zone;information from device sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses, microphones, and whether you have headphones connected; andinformation about your wireless and mobile network connections, such as mobile phone number, service provider, IP address, and signal strength.Device Phonebook. Because Snapchat is all about communicating with friends, we may—with your permission—collect information from your device’s phonebook.Camera and Photos.
