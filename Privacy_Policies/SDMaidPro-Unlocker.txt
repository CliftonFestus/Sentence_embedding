SD Maid - PrivacySD Maid and your Privacy				This document explains what information SD Maid collects, why it's done and how it's done.				SD Maid requests the permission "android.permission.INTERNET" to communicate with my server. This is nothing you need to be concerned about and it is nothing I want to hide. If you are looking for 10 pages of cryptic legal text, I will have to disappoint you. What I can offer is an honest explanation about what is done and why it is done. SD Maid has grown so much in both user numbers and features that I need a few tools to help me keep an overview. The goal for any of this is to help me improve SD Maid.				I do not collect personal information, neither do I sell or otherwise misappropriate any collected data.				SD Maid works perfectly fine without internet. If you don't have internet or want to block SD Maid from it, it will have no adverse effect.				If you still have questions or concerns after reading all the details, feel free to contact me!			Crash tracking				When a crash happens a report will be generated that contains the crash details and information about SD Maid and your device. It saves you the trouble of having to tell me about a crash and makes it easier for me to fix it. Google already provides some crash tracking via Google Play, but it's not very comfortable to use and fairly unreliable in terms of what crashs you are told about. This is voluntary and you can opt out of this in the settings.				SD Maid v4+ uses Bugsnag. The sourcecode of their client side plugin is available on Github. The crash data is stored on their servers and their privacy policy applies.                        MatomoMatomo is an open source analytics framework. It's sourcecode is also available on GitHub, server-side and client-side.				Matomo has two purposes. The first purpose is to aggregated global statistics. While I do get some numbers from Google Play, not everyone has access to Google Play and others don't want to use it. It also allows me to track inofficial device features, e.g. how many devices are rooted, which Google Play doesn't track, but is a fairly important stat for SD Maid.				The second purpose is to know more about how SD Maid is used. I talk with many users via mails, read many reviews and often even watch discussion about SD Maid on social media or forums, but this is only a small glimpse. Matomo will help me to get a better understanding on a large scale. Is there a missing language? What the are the most and least used features? Having this information will allow me to better allocate my time and resources. This is also voluntary and you can opt out of this in the settings.			Update-check				Upon launch SD Maid will tell my server its version and in return get told if there is an update. There are quite a few people who use SD Maid without Google Play and this allows them know about updates without manually checking.			ClutterReporter				The ClutterReporter is a manual tool inside the Explorer and CorpseFinder. It allows you to tell me about false results or report files/directories that SD Maid doesn't know. You use it to tell me to which app a file or directory belongs. I regularly review these reports and improve SD Maids databases accordingly.
