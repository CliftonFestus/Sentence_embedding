Naturally, these items may contain personal or sensitive information. However, DiskDigger does not do anything with this data except display it and allow the user to recover it (save it to a new location, as chosen by the user). DiskDigger does not write or transmit any recoverable data without the user's knowledge.DiskDigger requires the permission to read and write your device's internal and/or external storage. This is for the purpose of scanning your device's memory to find recoverable files. If your device is rooted, DiskDigger also asks the permission for full access to your device's storage. This is for the purpose of performing a complete low-level scan of the device's internal memory and any removable media, to maximize the effectiveness of the data recovery. The app does not use these permissions for any other purpose.The recoverable results shown by the app come from your device's local storage, and no other source. After the scan process is complete, the app does not leave any other long-running processes in the background, or perform any additional actions when the device starts up.Anonymous crash reportingIf the app experiences a crash, it may automatically send an anonymous crash report to the distribution channel through which it was installed (e.g. the Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore, Huawei App Store, etc). This is for the purpose of continually improving the app and ensuring that it works properly on a wide range of devices. Copyright © 2010-2020 Defiant Technologies, LLC.Privacy policy.
